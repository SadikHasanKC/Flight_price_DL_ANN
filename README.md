# Flight_price_DL_ANN
Deep learning using ANN on flight price prediction dataset

For the purpose of this assignment, the group utilized the flight price predictor dataset from M1. This dataset shows different airlines, flight, destination etc. utilized to predict the price.
The assignment goal was to create an ANN model utilizing Pytorch. The process was feature selecting, feature engineering and preprocessing. The data was then split into a train and test set, which was utilized to build a ANN. Multiple varitions of the ANN model was made to test different hyperparameters to see which one would generate the lowest loss. Finally the model was validated on the test set showing an average loss of 0.5574
